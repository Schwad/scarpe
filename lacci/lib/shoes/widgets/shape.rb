  # A Shape acts as a sort of union type for drawn shapes. In Shoes you can use it to merge multiple
  # ovals, arcs, stars, etc. into a single drawn shape.
  #
  # In Shoes3, a Shape isn't really a Slot. It's a kind of DSL with drawing commands that happen
  # to have the same name as the Art widgets like star, arc, etc. Here we're treating it as
  # a slot containing those widgets, which is wrong but not *too* wrong.
  #
  # @incompatibility A Shoes3 Shape is *not* a slot; Scarpe does *not* do union shapes
