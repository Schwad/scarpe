# frozen_string_literal: true

# Certain Shoes calls like motion and keydown are basically an
# event subscription, with no other visible presence. However,
# they have a place in the drawable tree and can be deleted.
#
# Depending on the display library they may not have any
# direct visual (or similar) presence there either.
#
# Inheriting from Drawable gives these a parent slot and a
# linkable_id automatically.
#
# Events not yet implemented: start, finish events for slots -
# start is first draw, finish is drawable destroyed
