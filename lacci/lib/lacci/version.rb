# frozen_string_literal: true

# The name "scarpe" means "shoes" in Italian. "Lacci"
# means "laces." Lacci is the display-independent part
# of Scarpe, tying the Shoes API to the display service
# of your choice.
#
# Almost nothing is called Lacci in your program. It's
# mostly invisible. Instead, look at the {Shoes} module
# to see what's in Lacci.
